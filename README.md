Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

Project Summary:

“Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning” is used to predict the lifespan on a human being, based on diverse datasets, in a demographic region. The life of a human depends on various factors such as Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. The project aims to predict an average life expectancy based on these and several other factors. This project finds the expected solution using various machine learning algorithms such as: Linear Regression Logistic Regression SVM Clustering Polynomic Regression The aim of the project is to find the relationship of the various factors with the lifespan of an individual using the ML Algorithms mentioned above. The dataset used for the prediction contains data from year 2000 to 2015. It contains more than 2500 entries and around 22 columns with various features like Population, Status, Alcohol, Infant Deaths etc., which aids the prediction of the model.

Project Requirements:

This project fundamentally aims in predicting the life expectancy. The primary requirement of the project is the suitable dataset which will aid the prediction. The machine learning model is trained on the basis of the data provided, such that it could predict the average lifespan of an individual in the coming years.

Functional Requirements:

1.The dataset should be preprocessed before applying prediction.

2.The data model must be created based on preprocessing.

3.The data model must then be converted into a module for further use.

4.The data should be implemented using IBM Watson which should then be connected to Node-Red for the User Interface.

Technical Requirements:

1.The dataset must be in csv format.

2.Machine Learning Algorithms must be applied with the help of Python.

3.IBM cloud account.

4.IBM Watson

5.Node-Red flow.

Software Requirements:

1.Python IDE

2.Excel Spreadsheet

3.IBM Cloud

4.IBM Watson

5.Node-Red
